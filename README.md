# School_District_Analysis
 
## Overview

During analysis is was determined that there was evidence of academic dishonesty in regards to 9th grade scores from a particular High School. While further investigation is required, it is determined that the suspect test scores should be removed from the analysis and summary data updated.

Analysis includes summary district data as well as summaries by school funding, school size, and school type. The school board has requested info on how the analysis was affected by the removal of the suspect test scores.
